#Finance

Finance is a web application that allows users to learn to trade in the stock market by first playing around with $10,000 in mock currancy.

Finance uses flask web developer, and an SQL database.

This application registers users, creates a secure login, and allows users to quote, buy, and sell stocks using current stock prices. Users can also access their history of transactions and current portfolio.
